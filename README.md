# Ethereum-Voting-Dapp
My first decentralized application built upon Ethereum blockchain. Kind of breaking the ice dapp :)

The application is extremely simple, all it does is initialize a set of contestants, let anyone vote for the candidates and display the total votes received by each candidate. 
The goal is not to just code an application but to learn the process of compiling, deploying and interacting with it.
